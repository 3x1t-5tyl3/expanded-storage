<summary>Modelled chests</summary>

___
Modelled chests act identical to vanilla chests however can generally hold more items.

They can also merge vertically and horizontally in the long direction to form tall and long chests in addition to vanilla's double chest (wide chest) and single chest.

<summary>Old chests</summary>

![Picture of old chests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quinn-semele/expanded-storage/documentation/descriptions/art/banners/full_cube_chests.png)
___
Old chests are like the modelled chest in visuals however occupy the whole block and do not have any kind of opening animation.

These may be better for you than modelled chests as not having a block entity renderer means they will have less impact on your fps.

<details>
<summary>Barrels</summary>

![Picture of barrels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quinn-semele/expanded-storage/documentation/descriptions/art/banners/barrels.png)
___
Barrels like old chests don't have a block entity renderer, so they will result in better fps over the modelled chests if you have a bunch of them in one area, otherwise they are functionally identical to vanilla barrels just with more inventory space.

<summary>Mini storage blocks</summary>

![Picture of mini barrels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quinn-semele/expanded-storage/documentation/descriptions/art/banners/mini_barrels.png)
___
Mini storage blocks are like chest and barrels but mini, they all can only hold 1 item and are ideal for gifting things to other players :D

Note: not all styles are craft-able and will need a Storage Mutator renamed to `Sparrow` to unlock.

<summary>Tools</summary>

___

The storage mutator is a tool to configure chest and other storage containers in world.

It currently consists of 4 modes, note not all modes are applicable to all storage types:
- Merge: Allows merging of two adjacent chests or old chests into a double chest.
- Split: Allows splitting a double chest into two single chests.
- Rotate: Allows rotating any storage container, note chests are limited to horizontal rotations.
- Swap theme: Allows changing the theme of the storage container, this only works for themes in the same tier.
