Stowage is an in-development rewrite of Expanded Storage planned for later release under the [PolyForm Shield](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/) license.

Expanded Storage has become a burden to maintain and Stowage will be designed to alleviate some of the pain points
experienced and whilst there is some code commited it shouldn't be considered part of the intended release.
